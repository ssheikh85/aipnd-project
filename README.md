# AI Programming with Python Project
Project Completed by Saeed Sheikh on Oct. 27 2018

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

Part 1: Image Classifier Project.ipynb(Jupyter Notebook)
This part of the project displays has all the code in a jupyter notebook,
Code included: Imports, data augmentation, and data loading, loading the pre-trained model, building the classifier, a function for validation, a function for training the network, a function for checking the network accuracy on the test image set, code to save the network as a checkpoint, loading the saved checkpoint, a function to pre-process a single inputted image, and a function to predict the image type, and code to display the image and top 5 probabilities
Datasets from the Udacity workspace were used, a single image from the dataset was used for preprocessing and predict
